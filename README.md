# SQL-Challenge
# This is my first SQL Challenge .
For this challenge , we  were equiped with 6 csv files , each holding data about employees,salaries,titles,
departments , department's managers(dept_manager) and department's employees(dept_emp) respectively.
This assignment is divided into three parts: 

# 1-Data Modeling
In this portion, we are tasked to inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an ERD of the tables. 

# 2-Data Engineering
In this portion, have to create a table schema for each  CSV files and specify the data types, primary keys,
foreign keys, and other constraints.For the primary keys, I will verify that the column is unique. Otherwise,
 i will create a composite key .We are also tasked with making sure that the tables are in the correct order 
 to handle the foreign keys and then import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
